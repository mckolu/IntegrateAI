I saw an iguana chasing a full grown cat across Biscayne Blvd in North Miami last year. And the year before, I was walking across my apartment complex to check the mail & as I passed under a low-hanging tree limb, the iguana sunning itself decided to thwop me upside the head with its tail!

I have 13xx/22xx crosman builds, and they need some mods to get them to hold zero properly. Daisy 1100s still shoots circles around them beyond 20 yards and has plenty more power.
I have other springers I like better. But the 1100 is the cheapest one I have that didn't need a single modification to shoot lights out. It has a good reputation for accuracy, aside from my single anecdotal experience.","Mon Jun 20 21:20:32 2022 UTC","1 point"

There's only one solution to the current population of invasive species in Florida, unfortunately, and that's culling. It can be hard culls like this or soft culls like trappers getting these animals and removing them to out of state homes (that's how I got my pet lizard), but these guys do so much damage to populations of native animals and plants it's not even funny.","Tue Mar 1 15:00:59 2022 UTC","1 point"

Too often I come across channels on YouTube like Catch em All Fishing who routinely abuse iguanas they catch by doing things like repeatedly throwing them into a pool while they're so cold that they can barely move and are on the verge of drowning. There's nothing wrong with hunting these iguanas and making use of their meat, but the blatant disrespect and animal abuse that follows many invasive species is not acceptable. Just because an animal is invasive that doesn't give you a free ticket to torture them.","Fri Jun 17 14:49:48 2022 UTC","11 points"

Studies show that the upward trend has been spreading from major locations south of Okeechobee, to more northern regions with expanding populations and culture impact in recent years. So much so they have become a potential hazard as some news stations issue an iguana watch in the winter as they have a tendency to freeze and fall out of trees. It's certainly a good time to invest if ever there was one.","Wed Jan 26 18:08:38 2022 UTC","28 points"

If they can do that to those pythons and iguanas down in Florida, why can't we do that with people? Aren't we overpopulated as it is? I'll gladly round up a whole lot of those young stupid breeders that MTV shows nowadays and have them for a main course. Why would I wear the furs of an endangered animal or the skin of reptiles when I can wear the skin of humans, think about that. If we have a fur and reptile skin trade, I'm sure that in an alternate universe, animals rule the world and we are eaten and worn as jackets, purses, shoes, hats and many other things.","Sat Feb 5 16:19:24 2022 UTC","1 point"

There is ZERO place in tax budgets to pay for iguana relocation when it is absolutely pointless and does not benefit us at all. Instead we should cut down their numbers and keep going from there.

Iguanas are great, and while I don't want a green iguana as a pet, I do like them.
They are, however, an invasive species in Florida. The most effective way of dealing with invasive species is to cull them to the point they can no longer maintain a breeding population. So while I don't enjoy the fact that iguanas have to die, I support people hunting them and hope they do so until the invasive population collapses. The same should be done with Burmese pythons, tegus, feral cats, feral peafowl, and every other invasive species.","Wed Apr 13 01:28:44 2022 UTC","2 points"

I get it, they’re invasive, but don’t go about killing them for sport or for fun. Also, due to other peoples’ negligence, reptile owners like myself will never have the opportunity to own another iguana again once my girl passes away. It’s a sad thought since I absolutely love iguanas, now I’ll never have the chance to raise another hatchling like I did with my current one. Her enclosure, everything I’ve built throughout these 10 years will all go to waste.","Tue Apr 12 18:59:05 2022 UTC","2 points"

But I've also seen the damage they can do to other critters (and us) and am realistic about the nature of these small dinosaurs. Personally I'd want to catch them alive and re-home them.
Realistically they ARE invasive, a single female can lay 20+ eggs and they have a high success rate so the population continues to grow and out-compete everything else. People constantly breed and import them for the pet trade everywhere else, so poaching them in the states doesn't solve the population problem.
If there was functional use for food or educational displays or some sort of purpose, it would feel a little better about termination - (remember that all our livestock are cute and sometimes dangerous animals, when I say that) - Growing up around farms maybe colors my perspective there too, because any ""pest"" animals that destroy crops or livestock are treated similarly.","Tue Apr 12 19:49:40 2022 UTC","0 points"

When I first started looking up iguana care videos on YouTube I was horrified by people video taping themselves competing to kill the most iguanas or set a record.
I live in Minnesota, so obviously I can't have an idea of the kind of damage they do in places like Florida. I was 100% against killing them, but then thought about deer in Minnesota and how legal, safe and measured hunting here (I'm not a hunter so I guess I can't speak to this, I just know a lot of very responsible hunters) keeps populations from getting so high that car accidents and other issues increase.
I think that while hunting iguanas is partly a solution to help the endangered species they compete with, Florida and other states need to seriously up their game on enforcing humane killing. I saw one video of a bow hunter triumphantly holding a dying iguana with an arrow through its leg and it made me sick.
I hate to see that invasive species, though they are causing some ecosystem damage, tend to be treated with more cruelty and as trash by the same activists fighting for the preservation of endangered species. At the end of the day they are ALL animals. If it was the other way around and iguanas were endangered, people would be using their intelligence, beauty and unique personalities as talking points as to why we should save them. It's not their fault they successfully survived in a new place, and in fact evolution is in their favor there. I guess I'm still conflicted about it. Lol!","Wed Apr 13 03:58:51 2022 UTC","1 point"

Normally not like that. They are good to eat. If you get them in the summer and harvest the teenagers, not to small and not the giant chonker ones. 1. Dispatch iguana. 2. Get super heavy duty scissors and cutoff arms, legs and tail. Remove hands and feet. Trim the tail to keep the fat part that is thicker than your finger. Dig hole near fruit tree, bury the body,feet, tail end. Let the tree “eat” the iguana. Circle of life! 3. Heavily season a pot of water, I use old Bay, boil until semi tender. 4. At this point, the skin easily slips off. 5. Then batter and fry as if they were chicken wings. Or pull the meat off and use in any recipe calling for cooked pulled meat. Like bbq, fajitas, soup, chili… Also, you can marinate the pieces and grill . Follow these steps and enjoy a clean, eco friendly protein source. 👍🏽","Sun Feb 13 15:30:38 2022 UTC","1 point"

There is no such thing as in ""invasive species"". Animals don't have countries, or borders, or RULES about where they are allowed to live or not.
They don't live in a certain country because they are SUPPOSED to live there, they live where they live because they can survive well there, or because their movement are limited by water, mountains etc. If we help them over the water or whatnot, then they are not limitedin that way any more.
If these iguanas can survive in Florida, then they can.
That's all there is to it.

He has guided iguana hunts from a moving boat and has trained dogs to retrieve them. He also sells iguana leather goods and uses the meat as hog feed. He is an invasive species hunter that is always busy in Martin County. Between boars, iguanas, and pythons he posts some great content.","Fri Mar 11 12:44:58 2022 UTC","3 points"

Surprised, as this has never happened before, I put some weight on the lid and let it be for a day or two. I didn't want a toilet-water rat running around my house if I tried to catch it, spreading who knows what. I suppose it really didn't want to swim back out, so it chose death. Tongs and rat went out with the rubbish on Monday.","Sun Aug 8 11:08:25 2021 UTC","92 points"

As a kid in the 90s, the occasional iguana would be cool af to see, now I literally can’t ride my bicycle down any street/sidewalk without worrying about hitting 4ft dinosaurs, and the literal 10-20 iguanas on my deck, sunning intimidatingly. If they ever decided to just not scurry away, we would be fucked. I love reptiles, but invasive exotic species ruin the party for ecosystems. RIP Everglades","Sun Aug 8 15:20:02 2021 UTC","39 points"

For anyone wanting a quick TLDR, they are an invasive species in Florida, mostly southern Florida. In the 1-2x year it gets cold enough, they’ll fall out of trees they sleep in due to stasis from their cold blood. Impossible to find and move these critter, Florida scientists encourage humane extermination by putting them in a freezer (painless, they basically just fall asleep and stay asleep).
That’s it. That’s all it is. I live down here currently and it’s nbd other than for memes. It recently got into the 30s for two whole nights in a row in central FL but has already reached typical temps again.","last edited 6 months ago","1 point"

The problem is, if they can find a food source, they'll sustain themselves. So then you need to hope they have predators - and that's where the problem is - usually they don't, so they overpopulate.
Much of nature sticks to eating what it knows so if you release something new, predators don't know what it is so tend to avoid.
In the case of lionfish, apparently it's very tasty so people are trying to create a consumer market for it as it will encourage people to go fishing for lionfish to sell to restaurants. I've also heard they are somehow trying to entice certain types of sharks to eat them as well although I don't know how that's going.","Sat Jan 1 12:00:56 2022 UTC","1 point"

Also inbreeding doesn't equal gene defects. Inbreeding just amplyfies the present genes. If there is no defect or just some defect that doesn't interfere with living successful in the new environment inbreeding is no problem. As those invasive species have no/few natural predators the living chances of the breed is enhanced, resulting in more healthy individuals.
Only if really crippling gene defects would occur in the early phase it would eradicate the whole population.
Also until the stricter laws were introduced and probably even now (just much much less often) some idiot abandons their pet in nature, releasing fresh blood for the population.
Many invasive species are either animals that have plenty of offspring or were released big style, like rabbits in Australia or raccoons in Germany.","Wed Oct 20 19:42:32 2021 UTC","7 points"

One of my neighbors had this little Jack Russel that she normally walked on a leash, but when they were out sunning themselves on the edge of the canals she'd turn him lose and he'd chase every single one of them into the water. The dog hated these things. It was comical to watch, and it had to piss them off because they had to swim for a while to find a place to get back out of the canals.

That's not my scene. They don't bother me at all, personally. But I'll give them one thing, the population has definitely drastically increased. On any given day I can go out behind my apartment and there will likely be a big ass, bright green iguana like 3 feet long soaking up a few Rays on the edge of the pool. You see smaller ones up in the trees, too. Sometimes they get run over by cars, too, which kinda sucks. They're everywhere lately.","last edited 3 years ago","2 points"

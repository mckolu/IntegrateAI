I saw an iguana chasing a full grown cat across Biscayne Blvd in North Miami last year. And the year before, I was walking across my apartment complex to check the mail & as I passed under a low-hanging tree limb, the iguana sunning itself decided to thwop me upside the head with its tail!

I have 13xx/22xx crosman builds, and they need some mods to get them to hold zero properly. Daisy 1100s still shoots circles around them beyond 20 yards and has plenty more power.
I have other springers I like better. But the 1100 is the cheapest one I have that didn't need a single modification to shoot lights out. It has a good reputation for accuracy, aside from my single anecdotal experience.","Mon Jun 20 21:20:32 2022 UTC","1 point"

There's only one solution to the current population of invasive species in Florida, unfortunately, and that's culling. It can be hard culls like this or soft culls like trappers getting these animals and removing them to out of state homes (that's how I got my pet lizard), but these guys do so much damage to populations of native animals and plants it's not even funny.","Tue Mar 1 15:00:59 2022 UTC","1 point"

Too often I come across channels on YouTube like Catch em All Fishing who routinely abuse iguanas they catch by doing things like repeatedly throwing them into a pool while they're so cold that they can barely move and are on the verge of drowning. There's nothing wrong with hunting these iguanas and making use of their meat, but the blatant disrespect and animal abuse that follows many invasive species is not acceptable. Just because an animal is invasive that doesn't give you a free ticket to torture them.","Fri Jun 17 14:49:48 2022 UTC","12 points"
